IBM provides the **Qiskit**, library used to run quantum computing programs. 
There is good documentation on qiskit to get started, set up and run programs.
Below are what I have followed.

Set up can be done either 
- Locally(on your personal system //TODO: Add more information
- Using online tools like qbraid(https://docs.qbraid.com/home/introduction) 

With either, steps are same at high level
1. Environment set up - bare minimum libraries
2. Configuring IBM cloud account
3. Write and run the quantum computing program - there is option is either schedule this program execution on IBM Quantum Computer OR simulate
